<h3>custom built face painting kit</h3>
<p>Over the years, I custom-built my own face painting kit and filled it with vibrant colours, paints, brushes and other tools. The custom layout of my kit allows me to perform a variety of painting techniques with a refined speed from years of experience working both large-scale public events and small-scale private parties. With my art and design background, I can paint nearly anything you can imagine or replicate from a photo. My specialties are painting animals, super heroes and logos.</p>

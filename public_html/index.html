<h3>Face Painting Artist & Entertainer</h3>
<p>💜 You will be amazed! I'm a Professional Face Painter offering a unique style of art with a background in graphic design. Over the past 15 years, I've honed my face painting skills by working events on evenings, weekends, and holidays across Oakville, Burlington, Hamilton, Mississauga, and Toronto.</p>
<p>🎨 And when it comes to parties - I bring it all. A professional custom-built setup, a friendly and patient disposition, and the creative know-how to paint anything your mind can imagine from animals, super heroes, cartoon characters, team logos, and more.</p>
<p>✨ From small birthday parties to large corporate events, you'll be amazed when you choose Face Paint by Erin to entertain your guests!</p>

<h3>What To Expect</h3>
<p>🏅 Expect the best of the best! I paint all designs by hand using cosmetic-grade face paints, brushes, sponges, stencils, gems, and glitter.</p>
<p>🫧 During events, I keep my equipment impeccably clean by sterilizing my brushes and using a fresh sponge for each guest. All designs are easily removed with mild soap and water!</p> 
<p>✅ Have peace of mind knowing the entertainer you're hiring is fully insured and brings all the equipment necessary to amaze your guests with the most extraordinary face paint designs!</p>

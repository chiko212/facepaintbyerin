<h3>Code of Practice</h3>
<p>We only use professional face and body paint, cosmetic glitter and products
that are skin safe and comply with <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/default.htm" target="_blank">EUA/FDA regulations</a>.
All of our paints are water based and easily removed with mild soap and water.</p>
<p>For the safety of all clients, we follow some basic guidelines during events:</p>
<ol type="i">
    <li>all paints, brushes, sponges and water are kept as clean as possible</li>
    <li>it is not recommended that children under two years of age be painted</li>
    <li>for children ages two to three years, we recommend a small design on the cheek,
        hand or arm only</li>
    <li>children/adults who are obviously unwell should not be painted
	(runny nose, cold sore, eczema, open wounds, etc)</li>
    <li>we will not paint anyone against their wishes, we stop painting if they
        become uncomfortable or change their mind</li>
</ol>
<br>

<h3>Artist's Preferences</h3>
<p>The artist reserves the right to work in a safe and comfortable environment.
We supply all the equipment required to safely paint your guests faces. With
advance notice, we can also supply a table and two chairs at no extra charge.</p>
<p>When preparing an area for us at your event, we ask that you consider the following:</p>
<ol type="i">
    <li>for all events, an area away from loud noises to make communication with guests easier</li>
    <li>for all events, a well-lit area and access to water is preferable</li>
    <li>for outdoor events, a tent or covered area to protect from the sun and rain</li>
    <li>when supplying table and chairs, we ask that they are sturdy and an appropriate/regular height</li>
</ol>
